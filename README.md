**Project Description: NBA Game Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project is a Python-based application for predicting the outcome of NBA games using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical game data and various features to train classification models that can forecast the winning team in future games. The project consists of three Python files: `get_data_live.py`, `parse_data_live.py`, and `predict_live.py`, which are available on GitHub.

**1. get_data_live.py**

The `get_data_live.py` file contains functions for scraping NBA game data from the web using the Playwright library. It asynchronously retrieves HTML content from web pages, navigates through the website, and saves the data locally. The functions in this file retrieve standings and box scores for NBA seasons from the Basketball Reference website.

**2. parse_data_live.py**

The `parse_data_live.py` file focuses on processing and transforming the scraped data to prepare it for machine learning. It utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content and extract relevant information. The file includes functions for reading line scores, team statistics, and season information from the scraped HTML. Additionally, it performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and target variable creation for model training.

**3. predict_live.py**

The `predict_live.py` file incorporates machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models for NBA game outcomes. It utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and RidgeClassifier for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation. The file implements a time-series cross-validation approach to account for temporal dependencies in the data. It applies feature selection techniques and trains classification models such as RidgeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier to predict the winning team in NBA games.

The project follows a systematic workflow, starting with web scraping to collect relevant NBA game data, followed by data processing to clean and transform the data for model training. Finally, the prediction module employs machine learning algorithms to forecast game outcomes based on historical patterns.

The project aims to provide insights into the potential of machine learning in predicting NBA game results, which can have applications in sports analytics, betting, and fan engagement.
